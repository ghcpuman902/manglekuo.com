# Intro

I wanted to find a way for Adobe Premier Pro and Adobe Media Encoder to export to a format where:
- It can be played on iOS, macOS, padOS;
- It can be streamed over AirPlay
- It can be put into Apple Music "Music Video" session
- without any issue, regardless of the frame rate, the bitrate, the aspect ratio, or the resolution.

And this is my result.

It uses HEVC / H.265 encoding, and uses Hardware Encoder, so it's fast on machine with GPU.
