# Heading 1

Hi hi hi, this is the project where I work on my website using Next.js, which is a full-stack solution that takes the advantage of React, and make it go beyond just a front end tool.

It uses edge network to make loading extremely fast and has optimization build in for images and fonts!

## Working in progress

I'm currently still working on this, I have been planning it for quite a while, and although what I've made so far is quite different from what I've planned, it's much better!

Currently we have a [https://manglekuo.com](https://manglekuo.com) homepage which is a duplicated version of my previous site made using PHP, but much faster, and with better user interface.

We also have a [https://manglekuo.com/tenfacts](https://manglekuo.com/tenfacts) which I was going to make it more feature free, but it's just as it is for now.

And what I'm currently working on is [https://manglekuo.com/alt](https://manglekuo.com/alt), and I'm very proud of it! 

The idea of the center animation came when I was experimenting using Illustrator and Adobe XD, it's Illustrator's blend, but animated. It took me quite a while to figure out how to do it. I ended up expanding it to layers than used custom ExtendScript to export each frame. Then I Time ramped in After Effect. There was also grain added to avoid encoder messing up with the gradient.

And it came out great!

## Present (now)

I'm currently working on the "Find mee" section, which is the social media links section of the site, and then I'll move on the "Things I did" and "Things I wrote" section.

The idea is to make it well-structured, easily understood, and funky and very me.

For me it's like my artwork that I want to take time to craft.

## Conclusion

That's it, thanks!
